## 🤖 About The Project
**Percentage Training Bot** is a Telegram bot running on Python3 which can be used during a training session. The bot is useful for the Percentage Training Programs to improve phisical strength, such as the ones used in sports such as Powerlifting, Weightlifting or Crossfit.

The bot registers the user's true or estimated 1-rep max for a certain exercise (also known as PRs or RMs). Once registered, the user can access to the table showing all the percentages of that exercise by just typing */${SKILL_NAME}*. 

## 🔨 Getting Started
1. Insert your *API_KEY* in a *.env* file placed in the root directory of this project. 
2. Install the dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    $> pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the *bot/main.py* file to run your bot on Telegram.
